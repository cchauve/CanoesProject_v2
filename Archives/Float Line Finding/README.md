In Bouyancy_Equilibrium.ipynb 
(I should make the file name shorter next update) 

We will have the main equilibrium demonstration. Graphs, ways to play with the weights, and so on. 


In Equilibrium.ipynb 
I will archive later, I have all the scribbles and tests I did to figure stuff out. It will not be included in the final version. It is just there for testing purposes.


Scripts/equilibrium.py Is the main script that houses the algorithm for finding the equilibrium float line of our surface. It uses binary search to find the appropriate level.
Scripts/plot_funcs.py Is just a copied scripts from Phase1 so that I could test the algorithm on our canoes. When we merge, we will use the script Haruto has worked on.
