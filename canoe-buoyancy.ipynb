If we let $D_c$ and $D_w$ be the densities (mass per unit volume) of the cube and water, we can determine their respective masses. The mass $M_c$ of the cube remains constant while $M_w$ can very depending on the amount of displaced water. We calculate it as follows: \n",

In order to rectify this problem we can use an important theorem in calculus called Gauss's Theorem or Divergence Theorem.

Then cut our search interval in half appropriately and repeat starting at the new center. This simple method can approach the equilibrium fairly quickly. \n",
