    "We start by gathering references of our canoe. Then we use those references to 3d model a canoe, it doesnt need to be a clean model, it just needs to have the same relative 3d shape. Then we fix bezier curves on that model that bet represent it, the beziers will outline the major shape of the canoe. During these two steps we will only be modelling one side of the canoe. This is because we can mirror our work over with *in package* modifiers. This will keep our boat symmetric and save us some redundant work"

    "To begin, we start by extruding vertices over the silhouette of the canoe. Then along the respective contours lines. However during this process one may notice some descrepencies. Contours not quite matching up, lines that dont appear on other side views, or it *doesnt look right*. This is usually because the reference isnt 100% precise or accurate. Curved surfaces are incredibly difficult to draw accurately so when we follow the refence exactly, those missalignments start to show. It's then up to the modeller to make adjustments that best suit the general shape. Luckily you dont need to be too precise, this process is only supposed to yield a model that'll aid you in the Bezier Curve Fitting section \n",

Some may notice that their canoe is fairly lumpy at this stage, this is not a big deal as there ways to smooth it out. This can be done manually if some spots have large bumps, but you can actually subdivide the surface to remove most of the lumps. You just need to *crease* some of the edges so that the general shape holds. In general its best to crease the countour lines presented in the reference\n",
