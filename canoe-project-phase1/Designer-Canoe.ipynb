    "This note book will go over the concept and steps needed for modelling a canoe. We will also go over how to import this model to Mathematical Canoes Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will mainly use <a href=\"https://www.blender.org/\">Blender</a> for this. The version we are using is <a href=\"https://download.blender.org/release/\">Blender 3.2</a>\n",
    "Since Blender is a confusing software (at first) we highly recommend watching <a href=\"https://youtu.be/nIoXOplUvAw\"> How to move, manipulate objects, and change view angles</a>. You should also watch <a href = \"https://youtu.be/imdYIdv8F4w\">how to edit objects and change meshes</a>. These tutorials are for making a doughnut, for our purposes we only care about being able to move around in 3d, getting the right unit scale, editting meshes and creating curves. We will still tell the specific steps and operations used to accomplish each step. \n",

    "We start by gathering references of our canoe. Then we use those references to create the 3d model, it doesnt need to be clean and perfect, it just needs to have the same relative 3d shape and sillohoute. This is because the calculations we employ on this surface are stable, small changes in the input lead to small changes in the output. \n",
    "We will take our 3d model and fix bezier curves along it to \"hold\" and define the surface. These are typically placed along major changes in the shape of the canoe. From the top edge of the canoe before we get to the interior, and along the bottom spine of the canoe. \n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that for consistency we will only be modelling one side of the canoe. This is because we can mirror our work over with *in package* modifiers. This will keep our boat symmetric and save us some redundant work. This will also be done with the Bezier Curves, however that will be done in the notebook, since it'll help us save on the needed calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the curves are placed, we will take the data to our notebook and convert the points into a shorter usable form thats easier to manipulate. "

Areas where the contours don't match up either because the lines dont appear in other side views, or it looks *off*. This is usually because the reference is not 100% precise. Curved surfaces are incredibly difficult to draw precisly so when we follow the refence exactly, those missalignments start to show. It's up to the modeller/ or canoe crafts person to make adjustments that best suit the general shape.
