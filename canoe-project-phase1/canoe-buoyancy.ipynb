    "#### General Case Approximation method\n",
    "This method allows us to easily approximate the equilibrium of any model by partitioning their surface into small squares. Nearly all objects can be made up of these squares/ quads. This allows us to gather that neccesary data for our approximation. We can store the positions, normals, and areas in a table and use them to calculate the $F\\cdot n$ part for each square. Using the area we can properly scale each vector to converge on a final summed force. Saving the data like this allows us to reuse as many times as we see fit. Adjusting how $F$ changes depending on the position of our points can allows us to get multiple different results.\n",

For our algorithm we used binary search, by taking the top and bottom of our canoe (plus some) as bounds to search through, we start at the center. We can determine if the total summed force with gravity and bouyancy is positive or negative. Then cut our search interval in half appropriately and repeat starting at the new center.
